overview: "some text",
challenge: "<p> In 2004 my social documentary projects with nonprofits became well known. Between 2004 and 2006 I was approached by over 170 content producers who wanted to work with me on projects about nonprofits. I had also worked with and built relationships with nonprofits worldwide who shared one common problem, they did not have the capacity to tell their own story.t</p>",
approach: "I researched over 30 NGOs and nonprofits to understand their messaging pains and content needs. I gained a deeper understanding of their stories and persuaded a few organizations that their stakeholders personal stories were the true message of their organization and that ultimately, though they had donors and board members, their actual stakeholders were the people they served. From there, I researched several voluntourism companies to understand their business model and how I to leverage that expertise for the concept of SalaamGarage. I also built noncompete business collaborations in order to outsource parts of SalaamGarage operations that didn't need reinventing such as the booking process, building tourist itineraries, and in-country resources.To market SalaamGarage, I leveraged my public speaking and book tours. I also followed up on over 100 email requests from content producers to ‘pick my brain’ and ‘be my photo assistant.’ I defined this audience as my target customer and offered them a chance to test SalaamGarage’s discounted, pilot trip to India.",

process: "Building trips and storytelling itineraries was a lot of fun because I am passionate about this space, UX, research, and product design. However, it took a lot of effort to convert interested participants because the margin was low and my target customer had a hard time reaching the cost of a trip. In an effort to scale, I contracted skilled content producers to lead SalaamGarage trips. However, because I was the face of the company, the target customer wanted specifically to travel with me and that made scaling more challenging.A few investors reached out to me and though their ideas to grow the business were measurable and valid, SalaamGarage was near and dear to my heart and I didn’t want to commercialize the company the way they suggested. I suffered from Founder's Dilemma.",
responsibilities:"some text",

results: "I hired, trained, and managed trip leaders to lead international trips: sourced, screened, interviewed prospective candidates and matched leaders with complementary groups. I managed all media relations as spokesperson for the organization both in the U.S. and abroad, personally led and produced global projects in Ethiopia, India, Guatemala, Morocco, South Africa, Kenya, and Vietnam, and effectively managed across cultures to build media teams in USA, Kenya and South Africa.I formed a partnership with Blurb Books and published an India, Ethiopia, and Guatemala books which were featured on the Blurb “Blurb for Good“ website ‘editors pick.' We launched 5 exhibitions resulted in matching NGOs with Microsoft’s Employee Giving Program and raising thousands for the nonprofits.SalaamGarage trips were featured in The Huffington Post, Social Documentary, First Post, aCurator, Cluster Munition Coalition, Seattle Post Intelligencer, and many other media outlets and blogs. I gave an Ignite talk that instantly raised $2100 for 7 fistula surgeries, and SalaamGarage participants raised thousands more dollars for participating non-profits which funded school fees, livestock, and various other local needs.I defined three KPIs. First, repeat participants, travellers and non-profits. Second, the non-profit benefited from our projects. Meaning, we set goals and met them such as funding a child's school fees, purchasing a goat, building an exhibition, etc. Third, SalaamGarage was to profit in such a way that it would scale. The first two KPIs were met. Where we failed was the ability to scale."

overviww: "Created by Amanda Koster (with a lot of support!), This Is Beautiful is an interactive media project showcasing the innate beauty of all women, regardless of age, race, ability, and size. This Is Beautiful spurred dialogue about women’s bodies and the lack of realistic images of women in media, a critical factor in the rise of eating disorders and distorted body image.",
challenge: "<p>Throughout my professional photography career, most women were worried whether they would ‘look fat’ in their photograph. I attributed this to the bombardment of images depicting irregularly slim women. Therefore, I wanted to create a body of work and a movement that equally bombarded the viewer with normal looking women and their ideas around body image.</p>",
approach: "I interviewed over 30 women about their body image and where they thought it stemmed from. I also researched eating disorder data that spanned various ages, ethnicities, abilities, and cultures. I concluded that photos would not thoroughly illustrate this topic and I wanted to include video interviews and text in the body of work.From there I authored a call-out and questionnaire to recruit participants. Pulling from my photography background I authored fully transparent model releases and questionnaire. I was awarded over $20k in artistic grants, in-kind donations, and procured over 15 sponsorships. I also recruited and managed a team of seven throughout the project.",
results: "<p>My team secured over $15,000 of in-kind donations in USA and Canada, including Kodak, Glazers, and PhotoLab. As Creative Director and Executive Producer, I led a production team of seven camera technicians, project managers, editors, and site scouts. We recruited approximately 100 volunteer participants from USA and Canada for photos shoot by leveraging social and traditional media outlets and local relevant non-profits and organizations. We produced five interactive exhibitions in USA and Canada. I was invited to speak at numerous meetings and media events, including FOX News, and over 10 international universities.</p>",
